# 3DRes2UNet-Replication
3DRes2UNet-Replication is a research-oriented implementation of the 3D-Res2UNet architecture proposed for lung nodule segmentation from volumetric CT scans. It faithfully reproduces the paper’s network design with a modular block-based structure and a forward inference pipeline, without including any training code.
